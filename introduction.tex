An onboard navigation system is necessary to control a free roaming robot. This navigation system is in contact with the user through an user interface. From here the user is able to control the robot when the user wants to, otherwise the robot should be able to autonomously do tasks on its own.\\
To be able to accomplish this there are certain subsystems that need to be implemented on the robot. These subsytems are seen in the function tree below.

These subsystems are explained throughout this literature report. From this report design choices will be made and these will be implemented on the platform called Zebro.
