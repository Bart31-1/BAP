Next to the telecommunication system on the user side there should also be a UI, user interface. In this UI the data from the zebro should be able to be displayed. The different data that needs to be displayed is the position and the surroundings of the zebro. Further the state of the zebro, sensor data from all the different subsystems (not only our subsystems). And a very important part is the video image. These are the different data packets that we will receive from the zebro and want to display. Of course from this UI it needs to be possible to send commands to the zebro. This could be something like commands to control the arm or the legs using a game controller, but could also be commands that lets the user switch between cameras or turn on or off certain subsystems.\\
The data logging our group will be responsible. And for the graphical part of the UI another member of the zebro team will be responsible.
