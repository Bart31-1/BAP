For the project our focus is on the zebro platform. When all the hardware is correct on the zebro side it does not matter how pretty the GUI is. It is only neccesary to send and receive the correct data. When there is time left it is possible to polish the UI. First thing on the list of things to do is making the design choices for the different subsystem and after that designing the PCB and making the telecommunication system. After this the different subsystems can be attached to the PCB, the camera and sensors for example.
