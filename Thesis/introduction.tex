To end up our Bachelor of Science we decided to join the Zebro Mars Rover project of Chris Verhoeven. This is a project of the robot department of the TU Delft.
In the past few months we worked on several modules of the Zebro robot. The Zebro is design to be unstoppable on Mars or in this case any terrain.
Zebro is a swarmrobot that can be controlled to do tasks and do specific task autonomously. The project will compete in September in the European Rover Challenge, a challenge in Polland organized by the European Space Agency (ESA).
This is an international challenge where teams from all around the world will compete with all different type of rovers to decide who's is best.

En nu gaan we naar Ethiek en Techniek, een feestje want vandaag gaan we rollenspel doen!
